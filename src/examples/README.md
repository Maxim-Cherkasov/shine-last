# Understanding Overloading in Programming

Overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows you to define multiple methods or functions with the same name but different parameters. There are several types of overloading:

## 1. Method Overloading
- Same method name with different parameter types
- Same method name with different number of parameters
- Same method name with different parameter order

## 2. Constructor Overloading
- Multiple constructors with different parameters
- Allows creating objects in different ways

## 3. Operator Overloading
- Giving additional meaning to operators for custom types
- Not directly supported in TypeScript/JavaScript, but simulated through methods

## Benefits of Overloading
1. **Improved Readability**: Same operation name for related operations
2. **Type Safety**: Compiler ensures correct parameter types
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple ways to use the same function
4. **Code Organization**: Related functionality stays together

## Best Practices
1. Keep overloaded methods consistent in behavior
2. Use clear parameter names
3. Document each overload
4. Consider using optional parameters when appropriate
5. Don't overload with radically different behavior
